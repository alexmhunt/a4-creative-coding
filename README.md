For this project, I created an audiovisualizer using Canvas and Web Audio API.

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- the instructions you present in the website should be clear enough to use the application, but if you feel any need to provide additional instructions please do so here.
